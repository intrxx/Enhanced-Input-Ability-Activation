# Lyra-like GAS Input System 

The goal of this small documentation is to show Lyra's GAS Input System in a small sample project so that the users can learn how everything is done without the need to dig into [Lyra's huge project](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/lyra-sample-game-in-unreal-engine/).
