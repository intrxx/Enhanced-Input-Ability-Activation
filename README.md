# Lyra-like Input System 

My implementation of the Lyra Input System for Gameplay Ability System plugin (GAS). In this system, inputs are handled by Gameplay Tags instead of integers. This is not official documentation and neither this project nor myself are affiliated with Epic Games. I make no guarantee for the accuracy of this information.

The goal of this small documentation is to show Lyra's GAS Input System in a small sample project so that the users can learn how everything is done without the need to dig into [Lyra Sample Game](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/lyra-sample-game-in-unreal-engine/).

The Sample Project and documentation are up-to-date with Unreal Engine 5.2.

The best example of this system and documentation about it will always be [Lyra Sample Game](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/lyra-sample-game-in-unreal-engine/) and source code.

## Gameplay Ability System

I am going to assume that you have your project with GAS done and working however if you're struggling with getting it to work or don't have a project at all you can switch to [Sample-GAS-Implementation](https://github.com/intrxx/Enhanced-Input-Ability-Activation/tree/Sample-GAS-Implementation) branch and copy the sample project with GAS implemented.
